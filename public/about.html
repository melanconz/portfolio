            <p>
                Programming and application development provides a seemingly endless stream of potential knowledge that I have been soaking myself in for nearly two years.
            </p>
            <p>
                I majored in English with a concentration in writing at Lousiana State University because I loved to create. I discovered and minored in Philosophy there because I love to logically solve problems, and I didn't worry about the amount of course work this
                would provide me because I am diligent, and I love to learn.
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn't until, five year after graduating and becoming a teacher, that I discovered programming, which perfectly combines those three passions: creating, problem solving, and learning. Once I decided to change careers, I quickly began to absorb knowledge
                and build skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                At <a href="https://www.bloc.io" title="opens in new tab" target="_blank">Bloc</a>, I learned <b><a href="/rails.html" title="opens in new tab" target="_blank">Ruby and Ruby on Rails</a>, Data Seeding,
              Test-Driven Development, Authentication, Authorization, Building and Using APIs, AJAX, and JSON</b> to build out scalable and perfomant backends, <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, <a href="/angular.html" title="opens in new tab" target="_blank">AngularJS</a></b> to build user interfaces that run smoothly, intuitively, and beauitifully.
</p>
<p>
              At <a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/" title="opens in new tab" target="_blank">IBM</a>, I took advantage of classes in <b>Java and Swift</b> for Android and iOS
                Development and <b>Bluemix, design patterns,
              algorithms, security</b> which allowed me to grow as a developer. I, also, began my first project building out the Angular front end for an application that used Watson technology to quickly and efficiently find caparables for companies
                being audited. During which time, I gained experience in <b>UI Grid, Angular Material, Agile Development
              and more.</b>
</p>

<p>
              At <a href="https://www.http://trinityis.com/" title="opens in new tab" target="_blank">Trinity Integrated Solutions, </a> I worked on multiple applications at a time. Some applications were built in
                <a href="https://www.quickbase.com"
                    title="opens in new tab" target="_blank">QuickBase</a>, which was created to limit the need for code, and therefore, required that I focus on building <b>JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, and HTML</b> skills. Other applications were mobile based, built using <b><a href="/angular.html" title="opens in new tab" target="_blank">Node.JS, Express.JS, AngularJS, Ionic, Cordova</a></b>                    as well as
                    <b>Jade, Sass, Angular Material, and other tools.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am working part-time, at night and on weekends, for Alzcare Labs a company that is working build technology that will serve as an infrastructure for
                <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/info/20079/dementia_friendly_communities"
                    title="opens in new tab" target="_blank">dementia-friendly communities</a>. I have built their top level website <a href="https://alzcarelabs.com/" title="opens in new tab" target="_blank">(alzcarelabs.com)</a> and will be leading the devlopment of their React Native iOS application
                    that connects to their <a href="https://alz.care/index.html" title="opens in new tab" target="_blank">FindMe</a> wearable IoT device.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Because this is not a full time position, I am hoping to find a company whose needs fits my skill set.</b>
